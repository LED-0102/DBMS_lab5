Please note that question-5 is combined into question-4
Tech stacks used here are Rust, React.js and PostgreSQL, so please make sure those are installed on your device.
Let's start with postgresql. Please update the constants in the .env file to change the username and the database name and user password according to you. Then execute the db.sql file to create the table.
Install rust and cargo using rustup. (Easy just search rustup installation on Google)
Install npm

Make sure the postgresql is running. Can be done by "sudo systemctl start postgresql"
Start the backend server by running "cargo run" in the directory where Cargo.toml file is located
Start the react server by running "npm start" in /auth-frontend
